# Progress Note (July 12, 2025)

## Context
- Working on Phase 4, Prompt 2 of the Webizen v0.0634 prompt plan: Key backup to IPFS and SolidOS pods, with SPHINCS+ signature and audit.
- `modules/security/index.js` has been updated so that `storeRotatedKeys` now:
  - Stores rotated keys in Quadstore and SolidOS pod
  - Backs up keys to IPFS using `services/ipfs.js` (`storeBackup`)
  - Signs the IPFS CID with SPHINCS+ (placeholder privateKey)
  - Stores the CID and signature in Quadstore and SolidOS pod
- No errors in the updated code.
- Unit tests for this logic have been added to `tests/unit/security.test.js` (with mocks), but running tests is currently blocked by a missing `@cashtab/wallet-lib` npm package.

## Next Steps
- Resolve the `@cashtab/wallet-lib` npm install issue (either by removing/commenting it out or providing a valid package).
- Re-run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are present.
- Run Jest tests to validate the new backup logic.
- Continue with the next prompt in the plan after confirming tests pass.

## File of Focus
