    - Added four new tests to the interactive test suite:
        - `testAdpSuccess`: Simulates a successful DNS lookup for an ADP record.
        - `testAdpFailure`: Simulates a failed DNS lookup (no record found).
        - `testCallVerificationAdp`: Tests call verification for a caller with a valid ADP record.
        - `testCallVerificationNonAdp`: Tests call verification for a caller without an ADP record.
    - Used "monkey-patching" to temporarily override the `adpManager.verifyDomain` method to simulate different outcomes without making actual network requests.

### Prompt 7 (New): Add a retry mechanism for DNS lookups

- **Details**:
    - Modified the `verifyDomain` method in `modules/adp/index.js`.
    - Implemented a `for` loop to retry the DNS lookup up to `MAX_RETRIES` (set to 3).
    - Added a `_delay` helper function to implement exponential backoff between retries, starting with `INITIAL_BACKOFF_MS` (200ms).
    - The retry logic specifically avoids retrying for definitive errors like `ENOTFOUND` and `ENODATA`, failing immediately to improve efficiency.
    - For other transient errors, it logs the attempt number and retries after a delay.
    - If all retries fail, a final error is logged, and the function returns `null`.

### Prompt 8 (New): Enhance `components/Mobile.js`
- **Task**: Enhance `components/Mobile.js` with a mobile-optimized UI for call verification status, including notifications for ADP/WebID mismatches.
- **Status**: Completed.

    - Implemented a React component with a mobile-centric card layout to display incoming call information.
    - Used `useEffect` and `setTimeout` to simulate a sequence of incoming calls for demonstration purposes.
    - The component calls `mobileManager.verifyCall()` to get the verification status for each simulated call.
    - It dynamically displays the verification status (Verified, Unverified, Verifying...) with corresponding colors and icons.
    - Added a specific warning message for callers that fail ADP/WebID verification, alerting the user to a potential spoofing attempt.
    - Included accessible "Accept" and "Decline" buttons.

    - **`modules/access/index.js`**:
        - Refactored to use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`).
        - Updated to import the `cashtabManager` instance instead of using `require`.
        - Refactored the `AccessManager` class to accept `cashtabManager` as a dependency in its constructor for better testability and consistency.
        - Corrected a stray closing brace in the class definition.
